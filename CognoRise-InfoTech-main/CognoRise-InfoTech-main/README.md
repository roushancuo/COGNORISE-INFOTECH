Task 1: COVID-19 Workforce Impact Analysis

Overview
The COVID-19 Workforce Impact Analysis project aims to investigate and shed light on the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on India's labour market. The primary focus is on understanding the dynamics of unemployment across various states in the country. This README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and details on the dataset used for analysis.

Problem Statement
As measured by the unemployment rate, unemployment has sharply increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project seeks to explore and analyze the impact of the pandemic on India's workforce and labour market. The key metrics under consideration include the unemployment rate, employment figures, and labour participation rates across different states.

Dataset
The dataset utilized in this analysis offers comprehensive insights into the unemployment dynamics during the COVID-19 crisis across India's states. It provides crucial information for understanding how different regions of the country have been affected. The dataset includes key indicators such as the unemployment rate, employment figures, and labour participation rates.

Task 2: 
Project: 80 Cereals uses the data “80 Cereals”, which is a dataset composed of 77 entries with 16 measured variables. We will use statistical methods to analyze a dataset of cereal ratings in order to effectively predict a person's rating for a cereal. We will test our predictions by answering the questions listed below.
* What are the most popular types of cereals and brands?
* Are there any relationships between sugar content and rating?
* Is there a relationship between fat content and calories?
* What are the most influential factors or features that contribute to the ratings of cereals in the Cereals80 dataset?

Through the utilization of a Random Forest Regressor, we gain valuable insights into which features wield the greatest influence on predicting consumer ratings. The bar chart showcases sugars and calories as two pivotal factors contributing to our ability to forecast ratings. Therefore,if ever we develop a machine learning model, sugars and calories emerge as the best candidates for predictor variables. With this, we can ready our data for the first step of Feature Engineering, which is Feature Selection.

Task 3:
Project Title: Wine Quality Prediction

The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of red wine properties and quality ratings to gain insights into the factors that influence wine quality. This analysis aims to identify key features that are most strongly correlated with high-quality wine and provide valuable recommendations to winemakers or enthusiasts for improving wine quality. The project will involve data exploration, visualization, statistical analysis, and the development of predictive models to achieve these objectives.

The project involves the analysis of a wine quality dataset, encompassing both exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling. This comprehensive approach aims to gain insights into the relationships between various chemical properties and wine quality, while also demonstrating the steps involved in data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.
I'm gaining insights into what dataset can be viewed as classification or regression tasks
